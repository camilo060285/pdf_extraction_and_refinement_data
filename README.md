# [Project Name] - Book Data Processing Pipeline

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) ## Description

[Choose one of the descriptions we discussed, or write your own. Example:]

This project is a Python-based pipeline designed for processing book data, particularly large files in JSONL format. It includes scripts for chunking files, extracting content while detecting specific "gaps" or missing information, and applying a multi-stage post-processing routine guided by configurable heuristic rules.

## Features

* **JSONL File Chunking:** Split large JSONL files into smaller, manageable chunks.
* **Content Extraction & Gap Detection:** Extract relevant information from book data and identify predefined gaps.
* **Multi-Stage Post-Processing:** Apply a sequence of processing steps to refine the extracted data.
* **Heuristic Configuration:** Customize post-processing rules and comparisons via a YAML configuration file.
* Modular script design for pipeline steps.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project requires several Python libraries. It's recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file containing the names of all necessary libraries (e.g., `jsonlines`, `PyYAML`, `pandas`, etc.).

    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root directory with needed libraries listed line by line. For example:

    ```txt
    jsonlines
    PyYAML
    pandas
    [Any other library your scripts use, e.g., nltk, spacy, etc.]
    ```

    Then, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *([FILL IN]: You will need to identify all the libraries your scripts actually use and list them in `requirements.txt`)*

## Usage

This project is designed as a processing pipeline. The typical workflow involves running the scripts in sequence:

1.  **Chunking the Input File (Optional, for large files):**
    Use `jsonl_file_chunker_script.py` to split your main JSONL file.
    ```bash
    python jsonl_file_chunker_script.py [input_jsonl_file] [output_directory] [chunk_size]
    ```
    *([FILL IN]: Specify command-line arguments or modify script to read paths)*

2.  **Running the Main Extraction and Gap Detection:**
    Process the original file or the generated chunks using `gap_detection_python_extract_books_final.py`.
    ```bash
    python gap_detection_python_extract_books_final.py [input_file(s)] [output_location] [other_arguments]
    ```
    *([FILL IN]: Specify command-line arguments, input/output formats, and whether it processes single files or directories of chunks)*

3.  **Applying Post-Processing Step 1:**
    Run the first phase of post-processing on the output from the previous step.
    ```bash
    python pos_processing_step.py [input_data] [output_location] [configuration_path - potentially heuristic config?]
    ```
     *([FILL IN]: Specify command-line arguments, expected input/output formats, and how it uses configuration)*

4.  **Applying Post-Processing Step 2:**
    Run the second phase of post-processing.
    ```bash
    python phase_2_post_processing_step.py [input_data] [output_location] [configuration_path - potentially heuristic config?]
    ```
    *([FILL IN]: Specify command-line arguments, expected input/output formats, and how it uses configuration)*

*([FILL IN]: Explain the expected input data format for the initial step (likely JSONL) and the expected output formats/locations for each step.)*
*([FILL IN]: If the scripts need specific arguments or environmental variables, detail them here.)*

## Configuration

The behavior of the post-processing and potentially other steps is controlled by the `heuristic comparation config.yaml` file.

* **`heuristic comparation config.yaml`:** This YAML file contains settings for heuristic comparisons and rules used in the post-processing steps. Review and modify this file to adjust the processing logic according to your needs.
    *([FILL IN]: Briefly describe the *structure* or *key sections* of the config file if possible, e.g., "It has sections for `rules`, `thresholds`, and `output_settings`.")*
